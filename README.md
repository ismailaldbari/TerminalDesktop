Integrating Terminal as the Desktop Environment in Linux
Overview

This project proposes an innovative approach to Linux desktop environments by integrating the terminal directly into the desktop. The goal is to replace the traditional graphical desktop environment with a terminal-based interface, providing users with direct command-line access to the operating system's functionalities without having to open separate terminal windows. The idea is to create a more efficient, customizable, and user-friendly environment for both beginners and power users.
Benefits

    Enhanced Workflow: By merging the terminal with the desktop environment, users can run commands and manage files directly from their desktop. This eliminates the need to switch between terminal windows and the main desktop interface, resulting in a more seamless experience.
    Beginner-Friendly: While it may sound intimidating, the terminal can be an excellent way for new users to learn how to interact with their system. The ability to display a background wallpaper alongside the terminal interface makes it visually appealing and less daunting for beginners.
    Customization: Users can easily modify the terminal's background, making it possible to display different wallpapers, enhancing the aesthetic appeal of their desktop environment. Additionally, the terminal window can be customized with various themes, fonts, and layouts to suit individual preferences.
    Optimized for Power Users: This project can be particularly beneficial for advanced users who are comfortable with the command line. They can use tiling window managers like i3 to arrange their terminal windows, allowing for a more organized and efficient workspace. Integration with custom scripts and tools is also possible to further enhance the experience.
    Resource Efficiency: Traditional graphical desktop environments consume considerable system resources, especially with background processes and applications running in the background. By switching to a terminal-based desktop environment, the system's performance can be improved by reducing the overhead associated with running resource-heavy graphical applications.

Proposed Implementation

    Using XFCE Terminal as a Transparent Background Process: The XFCE terminal would be configured to run as the primary process for the desktop environment. It would function in a transparent mode, allowing users to interact with the system through a command-line interface while maintaining the ability to use custom backgrounds.
    Tiling Window Manager Integration: To allow for efficient window management, this environment would be compatible with tiling window managers like i3. This integration would enable users to organize multiple terminal windows, monitor system resources, or work on various projects simultaneously with minimal distractions.
    Configurable Background: The terminal's background can be configured to display images or wallpapers, creating a more personalized environment for the user. This feature would appeal to users who enjoy customizing their workspace while still maintaining a focus on the terminal interface.
    Toggle Feature: Users can toggle between the terminal-based desktop environment and a traditional desktop environment. This flexibility makes it easier for both new users who are just starting and advanced users who rely heavily on the command line.

Existing Similar Concepts

    i3 Tiling Window Manager: i3 is a popular tiling window manager that heavily integrates terminal usage into the desktop environment. It allows users to manage multiple windows efficiently and is widely favored by power users.
    Tilix & Terminator: These terminal emulators provide advanced features like split views and session management, allowing users to manage multiple terminals at once. This concept can be integrated into the terminal-based desktop environment to improve productivity.
    Guake/Yakuake: These drop-down terminal programs allow users to quickly access a terminal from any window by pressing a hotkey. The drop-down feature could also be implemented in this project for convenience.
